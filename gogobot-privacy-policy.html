    <h1>Privacy Policy for GoGoBot</h1>
    <p>GoGoBot (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how our application works. This Privacy Policy explains how our app interacts with Facebook and other platforms, what information we may have access to, and how we handle it.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. Our application’s main purpose is to help automate posting and manage content for ourselves. We do not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Request your personal data such as name, email, phone number, or address.</li>
        <li>Track your activity across websites or apps.</li>
        <li>Collect or sell user data for advertising or marketing purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information We May Access Indirectly</h2>
    <p>To provide its automation features, the app may temporarily access data permitted by Facebook’s API (such as access tokens or page post permissions). This data is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used only to execute the tasks you authorize (e.g., posting content to your page or group).</li>
        <li>Not stored permanently by us.</li>
        <li>Not shared with any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>Any data obtained through the Facebook API is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Post or manage content according to your instructions.</li>
        <li>Maintain the basic functionality of the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use this data for analytics, advertising, or profiling.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app may rely on third-party platforms (such as Facebook’s developer tools) to operate. These services have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Although we do not permanently store user data, we take reasonable technical and organizational measures to ensure that any temporary information accessed is kept secure and used only for its intended purpose.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights & Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or would like us to remove any information associated with your use of the app, please contact us:</p>
